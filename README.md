# Portfolio of Logan Coffey
This portfolio is slightly unconventional. I want it to be a place that stores a vast majority of my knowledge. Because of this, I will be adding notes and various skills that I've learned. I will add projects as I finish them. Essentially, I want this portfolio to act as a place of reference of my knowledge that is trackable (i.e. when I learn certain skills), and to act as a traditional portfolio with my projects. Additionally, I want it to track my story. 

## The Story:
### Early Life:
I grew up in South-West Ohio. Growing up I found an early love for computers. I started playing games and dedicated myself in high school and became a top 63 player in North America in my respective game. Because of this, I learned early on what it takes to work towards being the best. And while I realize now that I may have missed out on certain aspects of life and had an improper balance, I will always be greatful for this mindset. I carry it everywhere and employ it wherever possible. 

### Start of College
In 2021, I started attending school at Bowling Green State University. I changed majors multiple times but decided to settle on Computer Science with a specialization in Digital Forensics.

### First Internship
For a while, I was still unsure about this major choice. I took a job at ASRaymond as an IT Intern just to fill a graduation requirement. It was a basic IT helpdesk role and I didn't mind it much. I was building computers, creating backups, writing documentation, managing active directory, etc.

### Introductory to CTFs
During my time working there I was allowed to listen to music/podcasts while I worked. I stumbled across a podcast named Darknet Diaries and instantly became addicted. I would listen to it on the way to work, during work, and on the way back. It inspired me to start doing CTFs. I started on the platform TryHackMe.
