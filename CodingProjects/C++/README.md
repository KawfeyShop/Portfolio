This folder is to showcase some of my coding projects that I have worked on. Below is a description of each of the projects:

BinarySearch: Normal binary search algorithm that showcases the search by taking a user input from 1-100 and see's if it's in the list.
HashTable: This creates a hash table using a double hashing algorithm. 
IsMinHeap: This takes a binary tree and determines if it's a min heap or not.
kthLargestInMinHeap: This takes an unsorted array, min-heapifies it, and returns the kth largest item in it. 
UpTimeDiagnostic: Work project that takes input from a file that represents the device(s) name and the content of the file which is the ip address, pings it, tells you which devices are not reachable and create a log file. 
Yahtzee: This is a recreation of the common Yahtzee game, I worked on this with my Software Engineering Group of Jacob Layton, Simon Born, and myself. It includes test cases and build file using cmake. The README.md in that directory contains the statement of contributions for that project.
