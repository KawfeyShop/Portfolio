The way to run this code is "scala scalaQuickSort.scala"

This will then do the quick sort function on books.txt creating an output file: TaskBOutput.txt which sorts by "usages" 

Usage 1: Sorts ISBN's in ascending order
Usage 2: Sorts ISBN's in descending order
Usage 3: Sorts book titles in ascending alphabetical order. 


This takes input from the file books.txt generated by Ruby's book generation file in Portfolio/CodingProjects/Ruby/QuickSort/bookGen.rb
This outputs to a file named taskBOutput.txt

The output is arranged in this order:
Usage 1, Usage 2, Usage 3.
