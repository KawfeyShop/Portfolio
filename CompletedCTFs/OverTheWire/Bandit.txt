Bandit level 1-5 were pretty simple and just required knowledge of how to ssh navigate a linux file system
 
Bandit level 6 was tricky because you had to do error handling. 
I eventually stumbled upon this command after some research:
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
the 2>/dev/null does error handling and hides all error messages allowing us to view the file. 

Bandit level 7 first time use of grep:
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth "data.txt"
millionth       TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP

Bandit level 8 first time with piping:
bandit8@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t

Bandit level 9 I tried so many variations of this and then had to look up the command. 
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep '^='
=2""L(
========== passwordk^
========== is
=Y!m
========== G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s
=r=_
=uea

Bandit level 10 Was very easy
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 --decode data.txt
The password is 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM

Bandit level 11 used ROT13 which was pretty cool 
bandit11@bandit:~$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
The password is JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv
