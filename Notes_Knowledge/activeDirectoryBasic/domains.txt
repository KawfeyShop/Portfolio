WINDOWS_DOMAIN:
A group of users and computers.
The domain centralizes administration of common components into a single repository called the active directory. 
The Domain Controller runs the active directory. 
This allows you to manage users and identity
This allows you to manage security policies enacted on users. 
Domains allow you to sign onto any computer connected to the domain using your one set of credentials if you are a user in that domain.

OU are organizational units that let you organize objects in them. 
There are both OU's and groups
OU's are for aplying policies to users and computers. Usually this is based off the role they have in an organisation. A user can only be a member of one OU
Security Groups allow you to grant permissions over resources. These allow you to access stuff like shared folders. A user can be a part of multiple groups.
When using OU's to delegate controls to computers, it's good to seperate them as workstations, servers, domain controllers. 
Domain controller pc's contain hashed passwords of all users. 

GROUP_POLICIES:
To configure, use the group policy management tool
For instance if you wanted to change minimum password policies, you'd go to Computer Configurations -> Policies -> Windows Setting -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy
After making a change to a gpo it could take 2 hours to complete on the computers, however, you could run the following command to speed it up: PS C:\> gpupdate /force
