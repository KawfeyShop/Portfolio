If a website gives you a means of uploading a file, it is extremely easy to get remote access via a reverse shell. 
Because of this, websites have combatted this with filtering. 

Windows uses file extension filtering, for example it wouldn't accept anything like a .exe file.

Linux uses Magic Number validation, which looks at the hexdump of the start of the file to see the extension.

However, both of these are semi easy to spoof. 

Therefore, there are more filtering techniques. Some include length filtering, MIME filtering, file name filtering, and file content filtering.

-Length Filtering checks to see if the length of the file is within the parameter as to not starve the server of resources. 
-MIME is very easy to spoof as it just checks the file extension. 
-File name filtering checks to see if there is already a file named that, in this case it gives it a different name so you may have to look around to exec it. 
-File content filtering is the best as it checks the file to see if it's spoofing it, however, this is the most complex to implement.
