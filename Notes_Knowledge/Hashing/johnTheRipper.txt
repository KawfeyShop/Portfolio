John The Ripper is a hash cracking tool. It's syntax is:
john [options] file
The file contains the hash. 

John uses dictionary attacks to crack passwords. 

To explicitly tell john which hash type to use do --format=[format]
If you're dealing with a normal hashtype use raw-[format] in front of it i.e. raw-md5.
You can search formats by using john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"

To use a different wordlist do --wordlist=[path]

NTLM passwords are used by linux to crack the hash use --format=nt
For /etc/shaddow hashes which are linux auth passwords you must use the /etc/passwd file as well as the etc/shadow file... there is a work around:
You can unshadow it 
Syntax: unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]
i.e. unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt
The format for these passwords are sha512crypt
The local_passwd file should look like:
root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
The local_shadow file should look like:
root:$6$2nwjN454g.dv4HN/$m9Z/r2xVfweYVkrr.v5Ft8Ws3/YYksfNwq96UL1FX0OJjY1L6l.DS3KEVsZ9rOVLB/ldTeEL/OIhJZ4GMFMGA0:18576::::::

Single crack mode: john --single --format=[format] [file]
To add a word for word mangling using single do [username]:[hash]
Word Mangling: when you take a username or other information and generate possible passwords for instance username: Logan it would come up with the password: Logan1, Logan2, etc. 
Gecos: John can go into and look at name of directories etc. used in etc/passwd and etc/shadow the gecos are seperated by a : and john turns this into the working dictionary. 

You can leverage password rules to crack passwords faster. For instance if you know the length, capitalization rules, etc. you can tell john these to crack the password faster. 
custom rules are defined in john.conf :: /etc/john/john.conf
to do custom rules, use regex. To find the rules visit here at task 8 https://tryhackme.com/r/room/johntheripper0
