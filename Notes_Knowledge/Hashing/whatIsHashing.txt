Hashing is a way to not store a password or data directly it uses an algorithm and is extremely hard to crack. If you want to crack a password you have to crack them individually.
Encoding is not the same as encryption. 
Collision is a big problem with hashing and can lead to a hash being cracked.
Collision is when two pieces of data are stored at the same hash.
Rounds are how many times a piece of data is hashed during the loop. 
Salting is used to avoid collision this is added at the front or back of a hash and is generated randomly. This doesn't need to be private. 
Graphics cards are the fastest way to crack hashes. -some like bcrypt are designed so they are roughly the same speed on cpus as gpus
Hashing is used for integrity checking for instance if two files have the same hash then they have the same data.
HMACs are used to check if the person who posted a message is who they claim to be. It also ensures that the file hasn't been corrupted or modified. This uses a secret key.

Common password hashing:
Unix: $format$rounds$salt$hash
md5crypt: $1$
Bcrypt: $2$, $2a$, $2b$, $2x$, $2y$
sha512crypt: $6$

Windows NTLM has 32 characters.
sha512crypt runs 5000 rounds.
