COMMANDS:
To view the meterpreter payloads available:
msfvenom --list payloads | grep meterpreter
Show payloads allows you to see different payloads when using an exploit.
Core commands of meterpreter (taken from thm):
    background: Backgrounds the current session
    exit: Terminate the Meterpreter session
    guid: Get the session GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
    help: Displays the help menu
    info: Displays information about a Post module
    irb: Opens an interactive Ruby shell on the current session
    load: Loads one or more Meterpreter extensions
    migrate: Allows you to migrate Meterpreter to another process
    run: Executes a Meterpreter script or Post module
    sessions: Quickly switch to another session



NOTES:
You can decide the payload based off the os i.e. linux, the components i.e. php, and the network connection types i.e. raw tcp connections
Some exploits will use meterpreter by devault, for example eternal blue

POST_EXPLOITATION: 
getuid command displays the user over meterpreter 
ps command shows lists of running processes 
You can migrate meterpreter over to different processors using the migrate command on the pid 
For example:
migrate 716 
This allows you to interact with this process and you can do things like 
keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, keyscan_dump to record keystrokes. 
Migrating could help make a more stable connection. 
hashdump command will list the Security Account Manager database which stores users and passwords on the system
You most likely won't be able to crack unique passwords from this but there could be rainbow tables online with the passwords. You can also use pass-the-hash attacks to authenticate in other systems on the network
The search command can help you find files etc.
The shell command will launch a shell on the target computer. Pressing CTRL+Z takes you back. 
The load command will help you get additional processes.
